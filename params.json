Also functionality around score combination, scaling and redundancy evaluation is implemented.\r\n\r\nThe package can be directly installed from github via the devtools package. For an overview see https://github.com/holtri/R-subcon.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
